# Hello, mortals! I am a bored heading.

## Lets print some text

>In the midway of this our mortal life,   
>I found me in a gloomy wood, astray   
>Gone from the path direct: and e'en to tell,   
>It were no easy task, how savage wild   
>That forest, how robust and rough its growth,   
>Which to remember only, my dismay   
>Renews, in bitterness not far from death.   
>Yet, to discourse of what there good befel,   
>All else will I relate discover'd there.

*Dante Alighieri*

Live long and prosper.
